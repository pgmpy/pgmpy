class EliminationOrdering(object):

    """
    This class implements tools to help finding good elimination orderings.
    Besically, a greedy algorithm scores each variables currently in the
    moralized graph, pick one, removing it, and score the graph again.
    The scoring is done by a cost function. From ('Probabilistic Graphical
    Model Principles and Techniques' - Koller and Friedman), "empirical results
    show that these heuristic algorithms [min-neighbors, min-fill, min-weight,
    weighted-min-fill] perform surprisingly well in practice. Generally,
    Min-Fill and Weighted-Min-Fill tend to work better on more problems".

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: input bayesian model
        A bayesian model to be moralized (an undirected graph where the parents
        of a v-structures are connected).
