pgmpy is a python library for working with Probabilistic Graphical Models.  

Documentation  and list of algorithms supported is at our official site http://pgmpy.org/  
Examples on using pgmpy: https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/tree/dev/examples  
Basic tutorial on Probabilistic Graphical models using pgmpy: https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy_notebook  

Our mailing list is at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pgmpy .

We have our community chat at [gitter](https://gitter.im/pgmpy/pgmpy).

Development
============

Code
----

You can check the latest sources from our github repository 
use the command:

    git clone https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy.git

Contributing
------------
Issues can be reported at our [issues section](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/issues).

Before opening a pull request, please have a look at our [contributing guide](
https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/blob/dev/Contributing.md)

Contributing guide contains some points that will make our life's easier in reviewing and merging your PR.

If you want to implement any new features, please have a discussion about it on the issue tracker or the mailing
list before starting to work on it.

Testing
-------

After installation, you can launch the test form pgmpy
source directory (you will need to have the ``nose`` package installed):
```bash
$ nosetests -v
```
to see the coverage of existing code use following command
```
$ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=pgmpy
```

Documentation and usage
=======================

Everything is at:
http://pgmpy.org/

You can also build the documentation in your local system. We use sphinx to help us building documentation from our code.
```
$ cd /path/to/pgmpy/docs
$ make html
```
Then the docs will be in _build/html

Examples:
=========
We have a few example jupyter notebooks here: https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy/tree/dev/examples
